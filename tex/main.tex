\begin{abstract}
Observations beneath Pine Island Glacier (PIG) have revealed the presence of a seabed ridge, which, in places, rises several hundred metres above the surrounding bathymetry. It is understood that this ridge, in combination with the ice draft above it, form a topographic barrier, restricting access of warm Circumpolar Deep Water to a cavity inshore of the ridge, and thus exerting an important control on basal ablation of the Pine Island Ice Shelf (PIIS). In addition, PIIS has experienced several large calving events in recent years, and further calving could significantly alter the cavity geometry. Changes in the ice front location, in combination with changes in ice thickness, might lead to a relaxation of the topographic barrier, and thus significantly change basal melt rates. Here, we consider the impact of past, and possible future, calving events on melt rates of PIIS. We use a high-resolution ocean model to simulate melt rates in both an idealized domain whose geometry captures the essential features of PIG, and a realistic geometry that accurately resembles it to explore how changing the ice front position (i.e. calving) affects melt rates. The idealized simulations reveal that the melt response to calving has a sensitive dependence on the gap between the ice shelf base and the seabed ridge, with melt rates varying significantly with calving in configurations featuring a narrow ($\leq$150~m) gap, but only weakly for those that feature a larger ($>$150~m) gap. The idealized simulations inform our interpretation of the realistic simulations, which suggest that the melt rates under PIIS have not changed significantly in dynamically important regions of the ice shelf in response to recent calving, which may act as a negative feedback on the ice shelf mass balance, promoting its regrowth. However, large changes in melt rate and an associated positive feedback are possible in future, if the ice shelf front calves beyond the seabed ridge.

\section{Introduction}\label{S:Introduction}
Pine Island Glacier (PIG), located in the Amundsen Sea sector of Antarctica, is one of the fastest changing glaciers worldwide. A sustained increase in ice discharge and surface velocity, as well as significant grounding line retreat, have been documented since satellite measurements began in the 1990s \cite{Rignot2002AnnGlac, Rignot2008GRL, Rignot2011Science, Mouginot2014GRL, Gardner2018Cryo}. PIG has experienced a 70\% increase in ice flux and a close to doubling of surface velocity between 1974 and 2013 \cite{Mouginot2014GRL}, while its grounding line retreated some 31~km at its centre between 1992 and 2011 \cite{Rignot2014GRL}. Increased basal melting of Pine Island Ice Shelf (PIIS) -- the floating extension of the grounded ice -- has been implicated as a key driver of these changes \cite{Shepherd2004GRL, Pritchard2012Nature, Rignot2019PNAS}: ice shelves offer a resistive stress (commonly referred to as `buttressing') that restrains the flow of grounded ice; increased basal melting can reduce ice shelf volume and thus the buttressing they are able to provide \cite{Gudmundsson2013Cryo, Reese2018NatureClimCh, Gudmundsson2019GRL,Gagliardini2010GRL,Goldberg2019GRL, DeRydt2021Cryosphere}.

%depth of the pycnocline is the most important factor
The main source of heat for ice shelf melting in the Amundsen Sea off West Antarctica is Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). In the Amundsen Sea, the pycnocline that separates CDW from winter water that sits above it remains mostly above the level of the continental shelf break \cite{Jacobs2015Oceanography, Heywood2016Oceanography}, allowing CDW to spill onto the continental shelf and reach ice shelf cavities. This provides ice shelf cavities with significant heat to melt the adjacent ice shelves. The volume of CDW that is able to spill over the continental shelf is a good proxy for the depth of the pycnocline; this volume, and thus the depth of the pycnocline is not constant, but varies significantly on decadal timescales~\cite{Jenkins2018NatureGeo}. Years with a deeper pycnocline tend to result in lower meltwater fluxes from ice shelves, and vice versa~\cite{Jacobs2011NatureGeosci,Dutrieux2014Science}.

%ridge in PIG makes pycnocline picture more complicated
For PIG specifically, this simple `pycnocline depth' picture is complicated by the presence of a seabed ridge in the ice shelf cavity. This ridge is located several tens of kilometers downstream of the grounding line, and protrudes up to three hundred meters above the neighboring seabed (black dashed line figure~\ref{fig:figure1}a). In combination with the ice shelf directly above it, the ridge acts as a topographic barrier that restricts the access of CDW to an inner cavity that has formed between the ridge and the grounding line, since the ice shelf grounding line likely retreated from this ridge in a process initiated in the late 1940s~\cite{Jenkins2010NatureGeo, DeRydt2014JGeophysResOceans, DeRydt2016JGeophysResEarthSurf, Smith2017Nature}. This cavity geometry means that the strength of the topographic barrier (i.e. how much its presence affects sub-shelf melting) is strongly dependent on the pycnocline depth: at its shallowest, the pycnocline sits above the depth of the ridge crest, and a large amount of modified CDW is able to spill into the inner cavity~\cite{Dutrieux2014Science}; in contrast, at its lowest, the pycnocline sits some way below the ridge crest and CDW access is severely restricted.  The presence of the ridge crest thus contributes to the strong sensitivity of PIIS melting to hydrographic conditions in Pine Island Bay (PIB): \citeA{Dutrieux2014Science} reported that the total freshwater flux from the fast flowing part of Pine Island Glacier in 2009 (80~km\textsuperscript{3} year\textsuperscript{-1}), when the pycnocline was at its second-highest level on record~\cite{Webber2017NatureComms}, was more than double its value in 2012 (37~km\textsuperscript{3}~year\textsuperscript{-1}), when the pycnocline was at the second-lowest recorded depth.

%another thing we have seen is significant calving events
In addition to its unique topographic control on melt rates, the recent calving of PIIS also stands out amongst Amundsen Sea terminating ice shelves. Mass losses from Antarctic ice sheets are dominated by calving and melting~\cite{Rignot2013Science}; in equilibrium, these losses must balance the upstream accumulation of ice. The recent retreat of the ice front of PIIS, however, suggests that the calving rate is far higher than would be required to maintain an equilibrium: the ice front retreated approximately 26 km between 2009 and 2020 (figure~\ref{fig:figure1}a), with the majority of this retreat happening over the period 2015--2020~\cite{Lhermitte2020PNAS, Joughin2021ScienceAdv}. This corresponds to a more-than-doubling of the calving rate, from approximately 4~km~year\textsuperscript{-1} prior to 2015 to approximately 9~km~year\textsuperscript{-1} in the period 2015--2020 (the flow speed at the ice front, for context, is approximately 5~km~~year\textsuperscript{-1} \cite{Joughin2021ScienceAdv}).

%at present, the ridge is located approx x km downstream of the ridge crest. The changes some far have been implicated in a speed up because of a loss of buttressing, but might the changes have also led to a relaxation of the topographic barrier and thus and increase in melt rates (that would only be evidenced on longer timescales(?)) [key question one]
As of 2020, the ice front is located approximately 20~km downstream of the ridge (figure~\ref{fig:figure1}); the ice front is now closer to the ridge crest than the location of the ice front in 2009. The loss of buttressing associated with this retreat of the ice front can explain the acceleration of PIG since 2015~\cite{Joughin2021ScienceAdv}. However, given that the topographic barrier to CDW relies on the combination of ice draft \textit{and} seabed ridge, the recent calving events beg the following question: have recent calving events relaxed the topographic barrier, leading to significant changes in melting in PIIS? Increased melting of ice shelves can lead to further reductions in ice shelf volume and thus buttressing, ultimately leading to ice shelf acceleration, thinning and grounding line retreat.

%but also, in future, we might have further calving events because or preconditioning and or MICI that might bring to ridge to the crest. How might these potential future calving events lead to changes in melt rates? [key question two]
In addition to considering the effect on melt rates of calving events that have already happened, we also consider how melt rates might respond to possible future calving events. It has been suggested that further significant calving of PIIS is likely: damage to the ice shelf that has already occurred is thought to have preconditioned PIIS to collapse~\cite{Lhermitte2020PNAS}. Additionally, there is a theoretical feedback loop in which damage leads to calving, which results in reducing buttressing and thus acceleration, which promotes further damage. We expect further calving as part of this feedback process, which also interacts with unbalanced melting. 

In this study, we use a numerical general circulation model (GCM) to simulate ocean circulation in both an idealized setup whose geometry captures the essential features of PIIS and its cavity (most notably, a seabed ridge and ice draft separated by a narrow gap), and a realistic setup which closely matches real world conditions for PIIS to assess how, and why, melt rates on PIIS might respond to past and potential future calving events. We begin in \S\ref{S:Experiment} with a description of the idealized experiments, setting out details of the ocean model used and the experimental setup. We identify one such experiment as a baseline;  results of this experiment are presented in \S\ref{S:Baseline}. In \S\ref{S:Results:lc}, we describe how, and why, the melt rate changes as calving proceeds from this baseline. In the following two sections, we discuss how the picture of melt response to calving presented in \S\ref{S:Results:lc} changes when the cavity geometry (\S\ref{S:Results:H}) and hydrographic forcings (\S\ref{S:Results:P}) are altered. In \S\ref{S:Realistic}, we describe, and present results from, the realistic experiments. Guided by the results of the idealized experiments, we assess the expected response of melt rates under PIIS to calving events. In \S\ref{S:Discussion}, we discuss the implications of our results, summarize the key results in \S\ref{S:Summary}.


\section{Experiment Details}\label{S:Experiment}
%broad overview of the experiemnts

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{../make_figures/plots/figure2.pdf}
    \caption{(a) Schematic diagram of the experimental setup. The domain is uniform in the zonal direction (into the page), with extent 48~km. The ocean domain consists of the gridded area, which is bordered by a passive ice shelf (shaded blue) and a seabed ridge (shaded brown). Solid, dashed and dot-dashed black curves indicate the location of the ice shelf base for $W$=100~m, $W$=150~m, and $W$=200~m, respectively (as labelled). Solid blue lines indicate the series of ice front positions considered within each `calving' experiment, located at 80, 75, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50, 45, and 40~km offshore of the southern end of the domain at $Y = 0~\text{km}$ on the right-hand side (the $Y$-axis is oriented in this way for consistency with the orientation of PIG in practice, see figure~\ref{fig:figure1}). The shaded red region indicates the inner cavity, defined as areas within 30~km of the southern end of the domain. (b) Temperature and (c) salinity profiles used in the experiments. Different line styles correspond to different values of the pycnocline depth $P$ as follows: $P$=600~m (solid), $P$=700~m (dashed), $P$=800~m (dot-dashed). Light and dark gray lines correspond to temperature and salinity profiles taken from conductivity, temperature, and depth measurements in Pine Island Bay during the austral summers of 2009~\cite{Jacobs2011NatureGeosci} and 2012~\cite{Dutrieux2014Science}, respectively.}
    \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}

In this section, we describe the setup of the experiments performed in an idealized setup, referred to as `idealized experiments'). The idealized experiments feature a seabed ridge and ice shelf (see figure~\ref{fig:figure2}), which are both uniform in the zonal direction, and thus so too is the ridge-draft gap between them. In practice, however, the ridge-draft gap is non-uniform (figure~\ref{fig:figure1}c--d); to capture the effect of this variation, we consider the melt response to calving for different thicknesses of the ridge-draft gap. We also consider several different far-field ocean conditions (`hydrographic forcings'): as discussed in \S\ref{S:Introduction}, melt rates of PIIS have a sensitive dependence on the hydrographic forcing via the depth of the pycnocline; we therefore postulate that the melt response to calving might similarly have a sensitive dependence on the hydrographic forcing, and investigate this effect.

The benefit of considering first idealized experiments is that, by simplifying the cavity geometry, we are able to isolate the important roles that the ridge-draft gap and the hydrographic forcing play in the melt response to calving, as well as elucidating the physical mechanisms responsible for these changes. 

We perform a total of ninety idealized experiments, each corresponding to a unique triplet of parameters that describe the ridge-draft gap, the hydrographic forcing, and the position of the ice front, which are described in the following two sections. By systematically shifting the ice front towards the (fixed) grounding line between experiments, we simulate calving (and use that name to describe this procedure), but stress that our model includes neither calving dynamics nor associated processes such as mélange formation. Within each experiment, we solve for the three-dimensional, semi-steady ocean circulation and associated melt rates simultaneously using the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm)~\cite{Marshall1997JGROceans}. Other than removing sections of the ice shelf, the ice shelf geometry does not change between experiments. Ice shelves themselves enter the ocean model passively, via the exchange of heat and salt at the ice-ocean interface and a steady pressure loading on the ocean surface (i.e. ice-dynamics are not taken into  consideration when determining the cavity geometry); a passive description of ice shelves is sufficient to assess the response of melt rates to ice shelf calving, which occurs on a timescale much shorter than that on which the ice responds dynamically to perturbations in melting. In the following sections, we provide further details of the ocean model and experimental setup, including the motivation for our choices of parameters.


\subsection{Details of Ocean Model}\label{S:Experiment:Model}
The MITgcm is a z-level general circulation model that includes a partial-cell treatment of topography, allowing an accurate description of both the seabed and ice draft. Our model grid consists of 110 layers with a vertical spacing of 10~m, and a horizontal resolution of 400~m. We use the MITgcm in hydrostatic mode with an implicit nonlinear free surface scheme, a third-order direct space-time flux limited advection scheme, and a non-linear equation of state~\cite{Mcdougall2003JAtmosOceanTech}. The Pacanowski-Philander \cite{Pacanowski1981JPhysOcean} scheme parametrizes vertical mixing. Constant values of 15 and 2.5 
m\textsuperscript{2} s\textsuperscript{-1} are used for the horizontal Laplacian viscosity and horizontal diffusivity, respectively. The equations are solved on an $f$-plane with $f = -1.4\times10^{-4}~\text{s}^{-1}$.

Each simulation is run for twelve months using a timestep of 30~\si{seconds}, after which time the configuration is approximately in steady state. The melt rates are within 95\% of their final values after three months. All results presented here are averaged over the final two months of the simulations.

As mentioned, ice shelves impact on the ocean state via the exchange of heat and salt at the ice-ocean interface. This exchange is implemented using the so-called "three-equation formulation"~\cite{Holland1999JPhysOcean}, whose implementation in MITgcm has been described in detail elsewhere \cite[for example]{Losch2008JGeophysResOceans, DeRydt2014JGeophysResOceans,Dansereau2014JGROceans}. Note that the temperature difference between ice shelves and the adjacent ocean boundary layer is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the temperature associated with phase changes ($L/c \approx -84{}^\circ$C, where $L=3.35\times10^5$ is the latent heat of fusion, and $c_p=3947~\si{\joule \kilogram}^{-1}$ is the specific heat capacity of water). Thus, thermal exchange across the ice-ocean interface is typically dominated by latent heat (over heat conduction into the ice). With latent heat dominated thermal exchange, the three equation formulation simplifies to give the melt rate $\dot{m}$ as
\begin{equation}\label{E:MeltRate}
    \dot{m} = \frac{c_p \gamma_T (T - T_b)}{L}.
\end{equation}
Here $T$ is the temperature far outside the viscous boundary layer that forms at the ice-ocean interface, $T_b$ is the temperature at the ice shelf base, which must be at the local (depth and salinity dependent) freezing point, and $\gamma_T$ is a heat exchange co-efficient that parametrizes exchange across this boundary layer. The heat exchange-coefficient $\gamma_T$ has a weakly non-linear relationship on $u^*$, the ocean speed adjacent to the ice shelf base~\cite{Holland1999JPhysOcean}. If this relationship were perfectly linear, $\gamma_T \propto u^*$, equation~\eqref{E:MeltRateUdT} would read
\begin{equation}\label{E:MeltRateUdT}
    \dot{m} \propto u^* (T - T_b).
\end{equation}
We shall return to equation~\eqref{E:MeltRateUdT} when describing the mechanisms responsible for the melt rate response to ice shelf calving.

\red{Need to come back to this comment -- see Jan and Paul's comments}
We use parameter values from \citeA{Holland1999JPhysOcean} in the three equation formulation, with the exception of the drag co-efficient, which is set to $4.5\times10^{-3}$, a value that is more appropriate for Pine Island Glacier (see \S\ref{S:Realistic}). (Note that the drag coefficient that enters the momentum balance, which can be set independently, remains at the standard value of $2.5\times 10^{-3}$.)


\subsection{Ice Shelf Geometry and Seabed Bathymetry}\label{S:Experiment:Geometry}
The geometry of the idealized setup is shown schematically in figure~\ref{fig:figure2}a. It is uniform in the zonal direction, along which the $x$-axis is aligned, and the $y$-axis is aligned along the meridional direction. Note that although PIG is aligned approximately east-west, we assume here that it is aligned north-south, as is standard~\cite{Grosfeld1997JGROceans, DeRydt2014JGeophysResOceans} (results are independent of this choice of orientation).

The sea bed has a Gaussian profile,
\begin{equation}\label{E:Experiment:Bed}
    b(x,y) = -1100 + 400 \exp\left[-\frac{\left(y - 50\times 10^3\right)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right],
\end{equation}
where $\sigma = 12$~km is the length scale over which this profile decays towards zero. The profile~\eqref{E:Experiment:Bed} corresponds to a ridge that peaks at a height of 400~m above the surrounding bathymetry. This peak occurs 50 km from the southern end of the domain at $y$=0~km, which we consider to be the grounding line.

In reality, the variability in both PIIS draft and the height of the seabed ridge result in a ridge-draft gap that varies between approximately 100 m at its narrowest to greater than 300 m at its widest (figure~\ref{fig:figure1}c--d). Since we use a zonally uniform same seabed geometry (and, in particular, the same ridge height) in our idealized experiments, we aim to gain insight into the effect of variation in the ridge-draft gap by considering several different values of $W$ -- the vertical distance between the crest of the seabed ridge and the ice shelf base (figure~\ref{fig:figure2}a). $W$ enters the model only via the ice profile. Following~\citeA{DeRydt2014JGeophysResOceans}, we use an ice shelf draft that is given by
\begin{equation}\label{E:Experiment:Draft}
    h(y) = \begin{cases}
    \left(\frac{310 + W}{2.64}\right)\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{5882} -3\right) & \text{for}~y < y_f,\\
    0  & \text{for}~y \geq y_f.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Here $y_f$ is the variable location of the ice front (see below). We stress that these ice profiles are not obtained from ice dynamics considerations, but selected for their qualitative similarity to PIIS: they include a flatter section offshore of the ridge and a steeper section inshore of the ridge that resembles variations in the basal slope from radar and satellite date. Note that the combination of the bathymetry~\eqref{E:Experiment:Bed} and ice shelf draft~\eqref{E:Experiment:Draft} means that the water column thickness is small, but nonzero at the grounding line; this is because the MITgcm requires at least two grid cells in the vertical to permit horizontal transfer.

We consider three different values of $W$ here: $W$=100~m, $W$=150~m, and $W$=200~m. The smallest value, $W$=100~m, corresponds to the minimum observed ridge-draft gap under PIIS (figure~\ref{fig:figure1}b,c), while the largest value, $W$=200~m, corresponds to an upper bound, above which there is little melt response to calving, as we shall see. 

As mentioned, the front position $y_f$ is systematically reduced between experiments to simulate calving. We consider a total of ten different ice front positions, using $y_f=84$, $80$, $75$, $70$, $65$, $60$, $55$, $50$, $45$, and $40~\text{km}$, which correspond to calved lengths of $l_c=0$, $4$, $9$, $14$, $19$, $24$, $29$, $34$, $39$, and $44~\text{km}$, respectively. Those experiments with $l_c = 0~\text{km}$ are referred to as the `uncalved' experiments, serving as a benchmark against which results for $l_c >0~\text{km}$ are compared. There are both pragmatic and physical reasons for choosing this particular range of values for $l_c$: the uncalved simulation corresponds roughly to the observed distance of the ice front from the PIG grounding line in 2009, before significant calving took place in the late 2010s; the largest value, $l_c = 44~\text{km}$, is chosen as a compromise between allowing us to consider scenarios in which the ice front has been retreated significantly beyond the ridge, whilst retaining a large area that is shared by each experiment (as we discuss further in \S\ref{S:Baseline}, the area over which melt rates are averaged must be invariant to calving for a robust assessment of the melt response to calving). 


\subsection{Hydrographic Forcing}\label{S:Experiment:Hydrography}
For each unique value of $W$ and $l_c$, we perform the experiment three times, each with a different hydrographic forcing. Comparing the results of these experiments gives us an indication of the sensitivity of our results to hydrographic forcing. The range of these hydrographic forcings covers that which is observed in practice (see below).

The hydrographic forcing is imposed on the model by means of a restoring boundary condition at the northern end of the domain: at this boundary, the temperature and salinity are restored to specified vertical profiles, shown in figure~\ref{fig:figure2}b--c, over a distance of five horizontal grid cells (total length 2 km) with a restoring timescale that varies from 12~hours at the boundary to 60~hours in the interior. The model includes solid walls with a free slip condition at the southern, western, and eastern sides of the domain. The specified temperature and salinity profiles are piecewise linear functions of depth: they are constant in both an upper (temperature $-1^\circ$C, salinity $34$~PSU) and lower layer (temperature $1.2^\circ$C, salinity $34.7$~PSU), which are separated by a pycnocline of 400~m thickness across which the temperature and salinity vary linearly. The pycnocline begins at a variable depth $P$ (a higher $P$ corresponds to a deeper pycnocline), which parametrizes the whole profile (figure~\ref{fig:figure2}b--c); the three hydrographic forcings we consider have $P$=600 m, 700 m, and 800 m. 

%why do we choose these conditions
These piecewise linear profiles are approximations to typical conditions for Pine Island Bay~\cite{Jacobs1996GRL, Dutrieux2014Science, Jenkins2018NatureGeo} (see figure~\ref{fig:figure2}a--b), where the upper and lower layers are primarily Winter Water and (modified) Circumpolar Deep Water, respectively. As mentioned, the record of hydrographic conditions in Pine Island Bay (PIB) has revealed significant variability in the depth of the pycnocline on interannual timescales~\cite{Dutrieux2014Science}; the profiles with $P$=600~m and $P$=800~m are approximations to profiles observed in PIB in the years 2009 and 2012, respectively. These two years approximately span the range of observed conditions: in 2009, the average depth of the pycnocline was at its shallowest level on record~\cite{Webber2017NatureComms}, while in 2012, the average depth of the pycnocline was at its second-deepest level on record (the lowest pycnocline depth, recorded in 2013, was only marginally lower than in 2012).

%wrap up the experiments:\ 
In total, we perform 90 experiments in the idealized setup. Each is uniquely identified by a $(W,~P,~l_c)$ triplet, where $W$ $\in \{100,~150,~200\}~\text{m}$, $P$ $\in \{600, 700, 800\}~\text{m}$, and $l_c \in {0,~4,~9,~14,~19,~24,~29,~34,~39,~44}~\text{km}$. We consider the experiment with $(W=100~\text{m},~P=600~\text{m},~l_c=0~\text{km}) $ to be the baseline; this corresponds to the extreme scenario with the narrowing ridge-draft gap (the strongest topographic barrier), the hydrographic forcing with the thickest CDW layer, and an uncalved ice shelf. In the following section, we describe the results of the baseline experiment. In \S\ref{S:Results:lc}, we present describe the results of simulations with $(W=100~\text{m},~P=600~\text{m},~l_c>0~\text{km})$; in doing so, we describe the melt response to calving for $W=100~\text{m}$, $P = 600~\text{m}$. In \S\ref{S:Results:H} and~\ref{S:Results:P}, we describe how this picture of melt response to calving changes for the different values we consider $W$ and $P$, respectively.


\section{Results for the Baseline Experiment ($W$=100~m, $P$=600~m)}\label{S:Baseline}
In this section, we describe the results for the baseline experiment with$(W=100~\text{m},~P=600~\text{m},~l_c=0~\text{km})$. This configuration corresponds to the solid black, red and blue lines in figures~\ref{fig:figure2}a, b, and c, respectively. We begin by describing the steady state ocean configuration in the uncalved simulation, and then describe how, and why, the melt rate responds to calving.

%describe each of what we see: melt rate, general observations
Ice-ocean properties that characterize the default simulation are shown in figure~\ref{fig:figure3}. Melt rates (figure~\ref{fig:figure3}a) are below  20~m~year\textsuperscript{-1} everywhere, except for a region located within 20~km of the grounding line, where melt rates reach a maximum of approximately 120~m~year\textsuperscript{-1}. The average melt rate over the whole shelf is approximately 20~m~year\textsuperscript{-1}; this is lower than the value of 33$\pm$2~m~year\textsuperscript{-1} that was estimated by~\citeA{Jenkins2010NatureGeo} based on observations in Pine Island Bay in 2009, to which the $P=600$ case corresponds (figure~\ref{fig:figure2}b, c). This discrepancy is in the expected direction: this simulation corresponds to the extreme scenario in which the ridge-draft gap is set to the minimum gap that is observed in practice.

%introduce the idea of the inner cavity, why do we use this metric
At this point, we introduce the definition on the `inner cavity' as the area of the ocean domain that is located within 30~km of the Southern end of the domain (red shaded region in figure~\ref{fig:figure2}a). We use the mean melt rate in the inner cavity, referred to as the `inner cavity melt rate', as a single metric to quantify changes in melt rate with calving. Since the melt rate is highly spatially variable (figure~\ref{fig:figure3}a) it is necessary to consider a fixed area, which is common to each simulation, when assessing changes in melt rate with calving. This best demonstrated by example: integrating over the whole shelf, for example, would make smaller shelves appear to have anomalously large melt rates, since the region of high melt close to the grounding line would occupy a greater proportion of the total shelf. %A spatially invariant area over which the melt rate is integrated is necessary because the melt rate under the ice shelf is highly spatially variable (figure~\ref{fig:figure3}a); for example, if we removed sections of ice in the default run \textit{without} changing the melt rate pattern, those runs with less ice (i.e. significant calving) would display larger mean melt rates over the whole shelf because the highest melt rates are concentrated near the grounding line.
Our choice of 30~km in the definition of the inner cavity region reflects a compromise between enabling simulations in which the ice front has calved a significant distance beyond the ridge (the smallest shelf we consider must be larger than the inner cavity region if the entirety of this region is to be included in each simulation), while including a reasonably large section of the uncalved ice shelf over which the melt rate is averaged. Crucially, this choice of inner cavity includes the grounding line, a region in which changes in melt rate are acutely important for the dynamics of the ice sheet \cite{Seroussi2014Cryo, Athern2017GRL}. Although the values of inner cavity melt rate \textit{are} dependent on the defined length of the inner cavity, we verified that the trends and key results are independent of this choice of inner cavity. The inner cavity melt rate in the uncalved run ($l_c$=0~km) is 46~m~year\textsuperscript{-1} (figure~\ref{fig:figure4}a).

%why does the melt rate look like it does
Melt rates depend on both the cavity circulation and thermal driving (see equation~\eqref{E:MeltRate}). Cavity circulation (figure~\ref{fig:figure3}a, c) is characterized by a Coriolis-driven cyclonic circulation. This circulation is directed northward at the eastern boundary ($x$=0~km) and southward at the western boundary ($x$=48~km). In the inner cavity, the circulation is vigorous to the south of $y=30~\text{km}$, but high melt rates are restricted to south of $y=20~\text{km}$: to the north of $y=20~\text{km}$, a cold and fresh meltwater plume sits adjacent to the ice-ocean interface (figure~\ref{fig:figure3}e) and the thermal driving is therefore much smaller than to the south of $y=20~\text{km}$, where the ice is adjacent to warm water.


%we can use the bsf 
When the ice shelf is calved in the subsequent simulations, we change both the buoyancy flux (the total volume of meltwater changes), and the water column thickness in regions of the domain where the ice shelf is removed. Changes in the water column thickness can only influence the flow through barotropic dynamics; it is therefore instructive to consider the barotropic stream function for the uncalved simulation first, and assess how it changes with calving. Assuming that turbulent stresses and viscous stresses are negligible, barotropic flow conserves its potential vorticity (PV),  calculated as $(f + \zeta)/h$, where $h$ is the water column thickness and $\zeta = \partial v / \partial x - \partial u / \partial y$ the relative vorticity, with $u$ and $v$ the depth-averaged velocity components in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. Conservation of PV means that flow must align with $f/h$ contours, or change its relative vorticity. In our idealized domain, contours of constant water column thickness correspond to lines of constant $y$, aligned east-west (figure~\ref{fig:figure3}b). The ice front and the seabed ridge are the two main discontinuities in the water column thickness, and therefore act as PV barriers; these PV barriers divide the domain up into three regions of closed $f/h$ contours: inshore of the ridge, offshore of the ridge (but under the ice shelf), and the open ocean.

Regions of closed $f/h$ space promote gyre formation because the flow must gain relative vorticity at their boundaries. Offshore of the ridge, a weak anti-cyclonic circulation spins up. Meltwater that crosses the ridge into this region from the inner cavity experiences an increase in water column thickness (reduction in $1/h$); in order to maintain a constant PV, the ocean must gain relative vorticity, diverting the flow anti-clockwise (increasing $\partial v / \partial x$ and/or reducing $\partial u / \partial y$). Similarly, as the flow approaches the ridge along the seabed, it is diverted eastward (figure~\ref{fig:figure3}c). Ultimately, however, the PV barrier in this `narrow gap' ($W=100~\text{m}$) case is sufficiently strong that little flow is able to penetrate across the ridge (note the zero barotropic contour at the top of the ridge in figure~\ref{fig:figure3}b). The ridge crest PV barrier means that barotropic flow is unable to leave the cavity, resulting in a strongly topographically controlled cyclonic circulation inshore of the ridge.

Away from the barotropic dynamics, a strong boundary current is set up at the eastern side of the domain (figure~\ref{fig:figure3}b,c), and the presence of meltwater sets up a zero depth-mean, vertically sheared overturning circulation. Although this flushes the inner cavity, it does so far more weakly than even a moderate barotropic flow is able to (the total flux into the cavity is 0.003~Sv, which is small by comparison with the typical barotropic circulation in the cavity, figure~\ref{fig:figure3}). As discussed, the PV barrier provided by seabed ridge and ice shelf draft prevents barotropic flow across the ridge; in the absence of significant flow across it, the inshore side of the ridge hosts meltwater, which is recirculated rather than flushed out. Water entering at the Eastern boundary mixes with this meltwater as it crosses the ridge; warm water that enters the inner cavity is lightly modified by this mixing, resulting in a bottom temperature that is slightly cooler (approximately 0.8${}^\circ$C) inshore of the ridge than offshore (approximately 1.3${}^\circ$C, see figure~\ref{fig:figure3}c,~e). This intrusion of warm water affects melting as it provides both significant heat to the inner cavity, and increases the stratification -- and thus speed -- of the topographically confined cyclonic circulation.

In summary, in this uncalved simulation, which has a strong barrier restricting CDW access to the inner cavity, a topographically constrained cyclonic circulation is spun up inshore of the ridge. A strong current at the eastern boundary provides the inner cavity with lightly modified warm water. The presence of this warm water enhances melting by both providing more heat and resulting in a stronger circulation in the inner cavity.

%We note that despite this simulation corresponding to a topographic barrier that is expected to be stronger than reality, several features are in agreement with observations such as the presence of warm water on the inner cavity, the presence of a strong meltwater plume that is coldest inshore of the ridge, and a weak hydrographic front that forms on the Northern slope of the ridge~\cite{Jenkins2010NatureGeo}.

\section{Melt Response to Calving}\label{S:Results:lc}
The inner cavity melt rate as a function of the calved length $l_c$ is shown in figure~\ref{fig:figure4}a. We see that, while the ice shelf front is located far offshore of the ridge ($l_c< 14$~km), removing sections of ice results in only a weak increase in the inner cavity melt rate. However, as the ice shelf front is retreated further towards the ridge, the melt rate increases dramatically, reaching a maximum of 73~m~year\textsuperscript{-1} (70\% larger than in the uncalved run) when the ice shelf is located approximately 5~km north of the ridge crest. Perhaps surprisingly, retreating the ice front slightly further to sit directly above the ridge crest results in a significant decrease in the inner cavity melt rate of approximately 15\% (from 73~m~year\textsuperscript{-1} to 64~m~year\textsuperscript{-1}). Finally, the inner cavity melt rate is approximately independent of ice front position when the ice front is located inshore of the ridge ($l_c>34$~km).

The blue curve indicates the change in melting relative to the uncalved simulation (equation~\eqref{E:MillgateDecompMelt}).}
    \label{fig:figure4}
\end{figure}

%explain what the Millgate decomposition.
To understand the reasons for this variation in melt rate with calving, it is instructive to return to equation~\eqref{E:MeltRateUdT}, which indicates that the melt rate is approximately proportional to the product of the boundary layer velocity and thermal driving. We use this to investigate the relative roles of variations in both of these quantities in the changes to the inner cavity melt rate. To do so, we compute~\cite{Millgate2013JGROceans}
 \begin{align}
U_{e}(l_c) &=  \frac{\int_{\text{IC}}~u^*(x,y; l_c)~\Delta T(x,y;l_c = 0)}{\int_{\text{IC}}~ u^*(x,y; l_c = 0)~\Delta T(x,y;l_c = 0)}~\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y, \label{E:MillgateDecompU}\\ \Delta T_{e}(l_c) &=  \frac{\int_{\text{IC}}~u^*(x,y; l_c=0)~\Delta T(x,y;l_c)}{\int_{\text{IC}}~ u^*(x,y; l_c = 0)~\Delta T(x,y;l_c = 0)}~\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y, \label{E:MillgateDecompDT}
 \end{align}
where `IC' refers to the inner cavity, and $u^*(x,y;l_c = 0)$, $T(x,y,l_c = 0)$ and $T_b(x,y,l_c = 0)$ are the boundary layer velocity, ocean temperature, and local freezing temperature that emerge from the uncalved experiment described in the previous section. The quantities in~\eqref{E:MillgateDecompU}--\eqref{E:MillgateDecompDT} are compared, for a given calved length $l_c$, to the relative change in melting over the default simulation,
 \begin{equation}\label{E:MillgateDecompMelt}
   \mathcal{M}(l_c) =  \frac{\int_{\text{IC}}~u^*(x,y; l_c)~\Delta T(x,y;l_c)}{\int_{\text{IC}}~ u^*(x,y; l_c = 0)~\Delta T(x,y;l_c = 0)}~\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y.
 \end{equation}
The quantities~\eqref{E:MillgateDecompU}--\eqref{E:MillgateDecompMelt} are plotted in figure~\ref{fig:figure4}b as a function of $l_c$.  Here, a melt response to calving that results exclusively from changes in the thermal driving would be indicated by indistinguishable blue and red curves, and a green curve that always takes the value one, while a melt response that results exclusively from changes in boundary layer velocity would be indicated by indistinguishable blue and green curves, and a red curve that always takes the value one. We refer to this comparison as a `velocity-thermal driving decomposition' henceforth. %(Note, however, that while the relative change in melt rate depends on the changes in velocity and thermal driving, this relationship is not linear.) 

%what do these plots tell us about what is responsible for the changes?
The velocity-thermal driving decomposition (figure~\ref{fig:figure4}b) indicates that both changes in the boundary layer velocity and thermal driving play an important role in the melt response to calving in this experiment (i.e. neither plays a dominant role).  When the ice front is located offshore of the ridge ($l_c < 25$~km), ice front retreat results in increases in both the boundary layer velocity and thermal driving; these increases are complimentary, they act in unison to increase the inner cavity melt rate with calving. When the calving front is retreated to sit above the ridge, the thermal driving effect increases further, while the velocity effect decreases sharply, indicating a significant reduction in the inner cavity circulation; further, this reduction in cavity circulation outweighs the increase in thermal driving, leading to an overall reduction in the inner cavity melt rate when the ice front is retreated to sit directly above the ridge. When the ice shelf is calved further, both the thermal driving and boundary layer velocity are approximately constant.

\end{figure}

%how can we understand what happens.
As mentioned, calving changes both the buoyancy forcing and the water column thickness, with the latter having an impact only via barotropic dynamics. To understand the reasons for the changes in thermal driving and boundary layer velocity, it is there instructive to consider how the barotropic stream function changes as the ice front is retreated (figure~\ref{fig:figure5}a). We focus first on those cases in which the ice front is located some way (more than 10~km) offshore of the ridge (i.e. $l_c<14$~km); these cases are qualitatively similar to the uncalved case: the strong PV barrier provided by the ridge and ice draft remains in place and a topographically constrained cyclonic circulation is spun up inshore of the ridge, with a weak anti-cyclonic circulation offshore of the ridge. There is little barotropic flow between these two regions (i.e. across the ridge, figure~\ref{fig:figure5}a). Warm water flows across the ridge at the eastern boundary, and is modified by mixing with the meltwater plume as it does so. As the ice front retreat proceeds, the meltwater plume becomes marginally less prominent (figure~\ref{fig:figure5}b--c). (This is because ice shelf area reduces, but the melt rate over the whole shelf remains approximately constant, so the total meltwater flux is reduced, see figure~\ref{fig:figure5}a). Mixing at the eastern boundary is therefore reduced and, as a result, the temperature of the warm water that enters the cavity increases, albeit only slightly; this has the double effect of both increasing the heat available for melting and increasing the stratification -- and thus strength of the circulation -- of the inner cavity.

\red{JDR and DB comments to here}
As the ice front is retreated and nears (but does not pass) the ridge, the two PV barriers (the ice front and the seabed ridge) approach one another, and the anticyclonic circulation in the outer cavity can no longer be sustained.  Despite the ridge crest and ice draft still providing strong PV barriers, a significant barotropic flow is able to cross the ridge. This is because the ice front induces vorticity in the water column through lateral shear, and this vorticity source allows the barotropic flow to break the $f/h$ constraint (note the ice front provides a source of vorticity \emph{wherever} it is located, but its effect is most noticeable when the vorticity as provided adjacent to the strong PV barrier that the ridge provides).  The resulting barotropic flow across the ridge is far more vigorous at flushing the inner cavity than the overturning circulation that flushes the cavity when the ice front is located further offshore; as a result, the inner cavity is entirely flooded with warm water (figure~\ref{fig:figure5}c). Although this means there is far more heat available for melting (thermal driving effect increases when calving on top of the ridge, figure~\ref{fig:figure4}b), this is outweighed by the reduced stratification and thus reduction in the velocity in the inner cavity (figure~\ref{fig:figure5}d).

Once the ice front is retreated beyond the ridge, the strong PV barrier provided by the ridge crest and ice draft is relaxed. The seabed ridge alone provides a much weaker $f/h$ constraint than the ridge and draft, so barotropic flow is able to cross the ridge. The cavity is again efficiently flushed with warm water, resulting in strong thermal driving but weak stratification. Melt rates become independent of ice front position once the ice front has retreated beyond the ridge, indicating that the ridge is only influential because it has an ice shelf overlying it.


\section{Effect of Cavity Geometry on Melt Response to Calving}\label{S:Results:H}
%what are we doing here and why (briefly)
In the previous section, we analyzed how the inner cavity melt rate responds to ice front retreat, and identified the mechanisms responsible, in the $W$=100~m case. The strength of the topographic barrier that restricts warm water access to the inner cavity was identified as an important control on this response; in this section, we describe how this picture changes for larger values of $W$ (explicitly, $W$=150~m and $W$=200~m), which are expected to have a weaker topographic barrier.

%how do melt rates change
%In figure~\ref{fig:figure6}, we plot the inner cavity melt rate and velocity-thermal driving decomposition as a function of the calved length $l_c$ are plotted in figure for both $W$ = 150~m and $W$ = 200~m. Comparison with the corresponding results for $W$=100~m (figure~\ref{fig:figure6}a) indicates that at larger values of $H$, the inner cavity melt rate is less sensitive to calving: the range of inner cavity melt rates reduces from approximately 27\mpryr for $W$=100~m to 10\mpryr and 7\mpryr for $H$=150~m and $H$=200~m, respectively. In addition, the peak inner cavity melt rate is reached when the ice extent is greater ($l_c$ is smaller) as the gap $W$ is reduced (approximately 29~km, 14~km, and 10~km for $W$=100~m, 150~m, and 200~m, respectively).

\end{figure}


%what do we see
Mean melt rates as a function of calved length $l_c$ for $W$=150~m and $W$=200~m are plotted in figure~\ref{fig:figure6}a. As in the $W$=100~m case, the inner cavity melt rate reaches a maximum when the ice front is located offshore of the ridge crest. In addition, the velocity-thermal driving decomposition indicates that for both $W$=150~m and $W$=200~m, the reduction in inner cavity melt rates for values of $l_c$ above that at which the maximum melt rate is attained results from a reduction in the inner cavity circulation, which outweighs an increase in thermal driving. There are, however, two important differences to the $W$=100~m case: firstly, the inner cavity melt rate is far less sensitive to calving for both $W$=150~m and $W$=200~m cases (the difference between largest and smallest inner cavity melt rates is approximately 20\% and 10\%, respectively, compared to 70\% for $W$=100~m). Secondly, these larger gap scenarios do not display a threshold-like behaviour, where the inner cavity melt rate drops suddenly as the calving front reaches the top of the ridge, as it does in the $W$=100~m case. These observations are consistent with the results of~\citeA{DeRydt2014JGeophysResOceans}, who identified that the melt rates in a similar idealized domain are largely independent of the ridge-draft gap when it is larger than approximately 200~m.

\red{JDR and DB comments here}
To understand these results, it is useful to compare the barotropic streamfunction, and zonal and meridional cross sections that were shown in figure~\ref{fig:figure4} for $W$=100~m to those in figure~\ref{fig:figure7} for the $W$=200~m case. (A comparison between the $W$=100~m and $W$=150~m cases is qualitatively similar to that discussed below, but the differences are clearer for $W$=200m.) Recall that in the $W$=100~m case, two PV constraint considerations are fundamental to the response: (1) when the ice front is offshore of the ridge, the ridge-draft PV barrier prevents barotropic flow into the cavity and inner cavity flushing is weak, but (2) ice front induced vorticity and the relaxation of this PV barrier as the ice front is retreated to the ridge and beyond permits a barotropic flow to efficiently flush the inner cavity with warm water. In the $W$=200~m case, the ridge-draft PV barrier is somewhat weaker than in the $W$=100~m case, and barotropic flow across the ridge occurs, even when the ice front is located offshore of the ridge (figure~\ref{fig:figure7}). The regime in which barotropic flow across the ridge is entirely blocked is never realized; the system behaves as in the `highly calved' regime for all values of $\ell_c$. As a result, the inner cavity is almost entirely flushed with modified CDW (figure~\ref{fig:figure7}b), regardless of the ice front position. Ice front retreat, which permits increased warm water access, has only a limited effect; in particular, this removes the tendency for both increasing temperature and circulation that we see in the $W$=100~m case, before the ice front is retreated to the ridge.

Although there is barotropic flow across the ridge for all values of $l_c$, when the ice front is retreated to -- and beyond -- the ridge, the ice front induced vorticity and the relaxation of the PV barrier mean that barotropic flow across the ridge increases further. As a result, the inner cavity stratification reduces (figures~\ref{fig:figure6}c and~\ref{fig:figure7}b) and as does the melt rate (figure~\ref{fig:figure6}a). However, the change in $f/h$ when the front is retreated beyond the ridge is not as severe, and thus the increase in barotropic flow is not as acute, as in the $W$=100~m case, and the sharp reduction in melt rates is not observed.



\section{Effect of Hydrographic Conditions on Melt Response to Calving}\label{S:Results:P}
Before moving on to assess how the inner cavity melt rate responds to calving in the realistic simulations, we briefly consider how the picture presented in the previous two sections changes depending on the hydrographic forcing. Since we consider a constant ridge height, variations in the difference between the pycnocline depth and the depth of the ridge crest -- which we expect to be a key driver of the quantity of warm water that is able to spill over the ridge and into the inner cavity -- is captured here by variability in the value of $P$.

% Introduce simulations with reminder of what they correspond to 
The inner cavity melt rate and velocity-thermal driving decomposition for the three experiments with $P$=700~m (hydrographic forcing as in the dashed profiles in figures~\ref{fig:figure2}b and c) and the three experiments with $P$=800~m (dot-dashed profiles) are plotted in figure~\ref{fig:figure8}. The results for $P$=700~m are similar to those for $P$=600~m: for the narrowest gap ($W$=100~m), the inner cavity melt rate is sensitive to the front position, increasing rapidly as the ice front is retreated towards the ridge crest, before dropping off sharply when the ice front reaches it, and does not change under further ice front retreat. For the wider gaps ($W$=150~m, $W$=200~m), the melt rates are far less sensitive to changes in ice front position, reaching a peak when the ice front is located some way offshore of the ridge (figure~\ref{fig:figure8}a) and decreasing steadily with further ice front retreat beyond this point. A velocity-thermal driving decomposition for the experiments with $P$=700~m (not shown) is qualitatively similar to the $P$=600~m case discussed above:  these results can be explained by the interaction between changes in the amount of heat that is able to reach the inner cavity and resulting stratification of the inner cavity. The similarity between the $P$=600~m and $P$=700~m cases is perhaps unsurprising when framed in terms of the relationship between the depths of the pycnocline and the ridge crest: in both cases, the CDW layer extends all the way to the top of the ridge (see figure~\ref{fig:figure2}) and thus the seabed ridge alone does not provide a significant barrier to CDW access to the inner cavity.

%results are different for P = 800 -- how?
In the $P$=800~m case, while the ice front is located offshore of the ridge, the melt rate is either constant or increases as the ice front is retreated, depending on the value of $W$ (figure~\ref{fig:figure8}b). A reduction in the boundary layer velocity is responsible for a drop in inner cavity melt rates as the ice front is retreated towards the ridge crest (figure~\ref{fig:figure8}c--e), as in the $P$=700~m and $P$=600~m cases. Beyond this point the $P$=800~m case differs: calving taking the ice front beyond the ridge results in an \emph{increase} in the inner cavity melt rate (figure~\ref{fig:figure8}b), which is associated with a reversal of the reduction in boundary layer velocity (figure~\ref{fig:figure8}c--e) (i.e. the boundary layer velocity increases on average when the ice front is retreated beyond the ridge). The important difference in this case that the seabed ridge alone is able to provide a significant barrier, preventing warm water from reaching the inner cavity, since the CDW layer in the outer cavity does not extend to the top of the ridge (figure~\ref{fig:figure9}). Therefore, the inner cavity is not flooded with CDW after the ice front is retreated to sit above the ridge crest and subsequent ice front retreat increases the stratification further. This leads to a strengthening of the circulation, working in tandem with increased heat content to increase the inner cavity melt rate.

\section{Assessing the Melting Response of PIIS to Calving}\label{S:Realistic}
% intro to the section
The experiments described in \S\ref{S:Experiment}--\ref{S:Results:P} reveal how melt rates near the grounding line in idealized geometries with a uniform ridge-draft gap may respond sensitively to calving. This response is heavily dependent on the geometry of the cavity and, in particular, the gap between the ice draft and seabed ridge. These idealized experiments inform our understanding of a similar experiment that is designed to assess the response of melt rates to PIIS calving. In this section, we describe this experiment, and present and analyze the results.

%Describe experiments
\subsection{Experiment Details}
Our experiments with a realistic setup are designed to assess the possible response of PIIS melt rates to calving in practice. To do so, we solve for the three-dimensional, semi-steady ocean circulation and associated melt rates simultaneously in a PIG cavity geometry (described below), using the ocean model described in \S\ref{S:Experiment:Model}. We consider six different ice shelf topographies, each of which has a unique ice front position. The locations of these ice fronts are shown in figure~\ref{fig:figure10}: the first simulation (darkest purple curve in figure~\ref{fig:figure10}a) uses an ice shelf cavity that corresponds to PIIS in 2009~\cite{Dutrieux2014Science}. The second simulation (second-darkest purple ice front in figure~\ref{fig:figure10}a) uses the 2009 ice shelf draft, but with a section of ice removed so that the ice front matches that in 2020 (the ice front is determined from a Sentinel 2 mosaic of PIG). The four further simulations similarly use the 2009 ice shelf draft but with sections of fast flowing ice (i.e. within the shear margins) removed. We stress that, as in the idealized experiments, the ice thickness, and thus grounding line position and ice shelf draft, at existing shelf locations remains the same in each simulation, and only the ice front position varies between simulations. 

%how do we get cavity and draft
The sub shelf cavity geometry we use is computed from the ice and seabed geometry, as described by~\citeA{Dutrieux2014Science}. Briefly, the ice shelf geometry is calculated from a 40~m-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) of the ice freeboard from 2008~\cite{Korona2009Photogrammetry}, that is adjusted with a constant median bias from observations obtained from the Autosub underwater autonomous vehicle~\cite{Jenkins2010NatureGeo}. The DEM assumes freely floating ice throughout the shelf, which may reduce its accuracy close to the grounding line. Over the continental shelf, the seabed geometry is well known from ship echo-sounding \cite{Dutrieux2014Science}, while in the cavity it is calculated from an inversion of gravimetry data and corrected point-wise using the median difference between the depth from the gravimetry inversion and the Autosub observations. 

%model notes and calibration
We consider a single hydrographic forcing, corresponding to observed 2009 conditions in Pine Island Bay (dark grey line in figure~\ref{fig:figure2}b--c), to which the ocean is restored far from the ice shelf. All model parameters are as described in \S\ref{S:Experiment:Model}. In particular, we take the drag coefficient in the three equation formulation of melting to be 4.5$\times10^{-3}$; this value is tuned so that the total meltwater flux in the simulation with the 2009 geometry (86 Gt yr\textsuperscript{-1}) closely matches the estimated total meltwater flux for 2009 (80 km\textsuperscript{3}/yr) \cite{Dutrieux2014Science})

. % The simulated melt rate for the `uncalved' simulation with the 2009 ice shelf geometry (figure~\ref{fig:figure12}a) is consistent with observations (not shown), displaying complex features on small scales, but characterized on larger scales as being concentrated near to the grounding line, with a peak melt rate of approximately 120~m~yr\textsuperscript{-1}.

%gap is not uniform, but sort of split. Tell the reader what the different regions are.
As mentioned in \S\ref{S:Experiment:Model} the ridge-draft gap under PIIS is not uniform but varies from approximately 100~m at its thinnest to 400~m at its thickest.  The ridge-draft gap (inset in figure~\ref{fig:figure10}) can be approximately partitioned into a northern portion where the gap is relatively thin and a southern portion where the gap is relatively wide. A region of locally elevated $f/h$ running east-west (solid red line in figure~\ref{fig:figure10}b) meets the north-south aligned seabed ridge at the junction between these wide and narrow sections (see figure~\ref{fig:figure10}); this east-west aligned section extends all the way to the grounding line, partitioning the region inshore of the main (north-south) ridge into a northern inner cavity (cyan box in figure~\ref{fig:figure10}a) and a southern inner cavity (magenta box). The east-west aligned section of higher $f/h$  provides a PV barrier between the two inner cavity regions, which are therefore approximately dynamically disconnected (figure~\ref{fig:figure11}a). In the following, we therefore evaluate the melt response to calving in the inner cavity regions separately.

\end{figure}


%introduce simulations
Melt rates (figure~\ref{fig:figure12}a) and cavity circulation (figure~\ref{fig:figure11}a) in the uncalved (2009) simulation are qualitatively similar to the corresponding idealized simulations. Melt rates are concentrated near to the grounding line, reaching a peak of approximately 120~m yr\textsuperscript{-1} several kilometers downstream of it, while remaining below 20~m~year\textsuperscript{-1} over the majority of the shelf. This pattern of simulated melt rates under PIIS is consistent with observations~\cite{Dutrieux2013Cryosphere} and other numerical simulations of cavity circulation under PIIS~\cite{Heimbach2012AnnGlac}. A cyclonic circulation spins up within each of the inner cavity sections, as well as in the outer cavity between the seabed ridge, and in the open ocean offshore of the ice front. Barotropic streamfunction contours largely follow the contours of constant water column thickness (figure~\ref{fig:figure12}).

Figure~\ref{fig:figure12}b--f contains plots of the non-cumulative melt rate anomalies for the other five simulations in the experiment. To be explicit, non-cumulative here means that red (blue, respectively) locations on these maps indicate areas in which the melt rate increases (decreases) when the ice front is retreated from its position in the next largest ice shelf, i.e. changes in melt are shown relative to the previous simulation in the series, rather than relative to the first (2009) simulation.

%2009--now: large anomalies at the front
When the ice front is retreated from its 2009 position to its 2020 position, melt rates within 10~km of the ice front increase significantly (figure~\ref{fig:figure12}b). This is attributed to high velocities associated with upwelling at the new ice shelf front, as well as the formation of a reasonably strong gyre in the newly exposed open ocean which is covered by the ice shelf in the 2009 simulation (figure~\ref{fig:figure11}b). This double gyre pattern is qualitatively similar to observations taken in PIB in 2020~\cite{Yoon2021}. The gyre adjacent to the shelf results in a strong circulation along the front, which itself acts a dynamic barrier to flow, as well as providing a freshwater source to further enhance the flow. Melt rates in the both inner cavity regions do not change significantly when the ice front is retreated from its 2009 position to its 2020 position: the average melt rate in the northern and southern boxes increases by approximately 1~m~year\textsuperscript{-1} and 2~m~year\textsuperscript{-1} respectively (figure~\ref{fig:figure12}a).

%Qualitative descriptions of melt anomalies: (a) characterized by complex patterns, (b) only see significant changes when calving beyond the ridge (large positive anomaly in the northern shear margin which might be important for stability), (d) melt rates decrease when ice front has retreated significantly (this is a lead in to the qualitative analysis of fig 12)
Melt rates in the simulations with ice fronts retreated beyond the 2020 position display complex patterns of change, which include large regions of both positive and negative anomalies (figure~\ref{fig:figure12}c--f). Melt rates do not change significantly in the first `future' scenario, in which the ice front is still located some way offshore of the ridge, in qualitative agreement with the idealized results. Melt rates in the vicinity of the northern shear margin increase dramatically when the ice front is retreated to a position that sits (approximately) above the seabed ridge (figure~\ref{fig:figure12}d), and this region of enhanced melt rates extends almost all the way to the grounding line. With the ice front immediately above the seabed ridge, the outer cavity region no longer exists; this is reminiscent of the idealized results in which there is a qualitative change in the behaviour when the outer cavity disappears and the only remaining regions of closed $f/h$ space are the inner cavity and open ocean.  %The barotropic component of flow is able to penetrate under the southern shear margin because a depression in the sea bed there (red circle in figure~\ref{fig:figure11} results in a reduced water column thickness discontinuity that can be overcome; this supports our earlier assertion that flow under PIIS is essentially controlled by PV constraints.  
This large melt rate anomaly is accompanied by a change in the direction of the circulation in the open ocean (figure~\ref{fig:figure11}d), which is consistent with conservation of PV: prior to retreat beyond the ridge, melt water leaving the cavity did so offshore of the ridge, where the water column thickness increases in the direction of flow; conservation of potential vorticity requires flow to be diverted clockwise. However, when the ice front is located inshore of the ridge, the water column thickness reduces at the ice front, and conservation of potential vorticity thus requires flow to be diverted anti-clockwise, setting up an anti-cyclonic circulation in the embayment.

In each of the plots, the black dashed line approximately corresponds to the calved length when the ice front sits approximately above the ridge crest.}\label{fig:figure13}
\end{figure}

%these qualitative observations sort of agree with the mean melt rate plots
To go beyond these qualitative comparisons, we plot the mean melt rate as a function of calved length for both of the inner cavity regions in figure~\ref{fig:figure13}. In the northern region, mean melt rates remain approximately constant until the ice front approaches the seabed ridge, where they increase sharply, before remaining approximately constant as the ice front is retreated further. In the southern box, melt rates are less variable (in terms of percentage change), but the overall trend is that the melt rate increases while the ice front is located downstream of the seabed ridge, before dropping temporarily when the ice front is retreated to the ridge and subsequently increasing again. 

 
%northern box 'hides' behind a narrow gap -- make comparison with the narrow idealized case
Our interpretation of these results is guided by the idealized simulations presented in \S\ref{S:Baseline}--\ref{S:Results:P}. In the northern box, the inner cavity is shielded by a relatively narrow gap between the seabed ridge and the ice draft (inset of figure~\ref{fig:figure10}a), and the change in melt rates with calving behaves in a qualitatively similar way to idealized results with narrower gaps ($W\leq$150~m). A velocity-thermal driving decomposition of these changes in melt rates (figure~\ref{fig:figure13}b) indicates that -- as in the corresponding idealized case -- both increases in thermal driving and velocity contribute to the increases in melt rate with calving while the ice front is located offshore of the ridge, and that a reduction in the boundary layer velocity is responsible for the decrease in melt rates when the ice front is retreated beyond the ridge. This suggests that the enhancement in melt rates with calving while the ice front is located offshore of the ridge is driven by increased heat reaching the inner cavity and concomitant increase in stratification, while the reduction in melt rates when the ice front is retreated to the ridge results from a flooding of the inner cavity with warm water, leading to a reduction in stratification. 

%In the idealized case, however, the effect of a reduction in the boundary layer velocity was stronger, and the decrease in melt rate larger, than in this realistic case; we attribute this difference to the splitting of a connected domain into two sub-regions, and the particular complexities of the realistic cavity.

%southern box 'hides' behind a wide gap -- make comparison with the wide idealized case
The southern inner cavity region sits inshore of a relatively wide gap between the seabed ridge and the ice draft (figure~\ref{fig:figure10}). As was the case for idealized simulations with wide gaps ($W\geq$200~m), the mean melt rate is far less insensitive to the ice front position that it is with a narrow gap (i.e. for the northern box): the difference between the minimum and maximum melt rates in the southern box is approximately 6\%, which is almost half of the corresponding value in the northern box. This invariance under calving suggests that the inner cavity is flushed with warm water in each simulation; calving, which acts primarily to increase heat content in the inner cavity, has little effect.

%The superimposed trend (increasing melt rates, except for a drop when the ice front is located on top of the ridge associated with a reduction in velocities, see figure~\ref{fig:figure13}) is reminiscent of the results of the idealized simulations with a lower pycnocline (see figure~\ref{fig:figure8}(b)--(e)); by drawing an analogy to the idealized results, this suggests that the southern cavity is not entirely flooded with warm water, and ice front retreat continues to increase stratification, even after the ice front has been retreated beyond the ridge.


\section{Discussion}\label{S:Discussion}
%loss of area led to increase in speed, but did it also lead to increase in melting which might promote further buttressing loss? Yes at the ice front, but not at GL or shear margins. This suggests negative feedback 
The results of the previous section suggest that the recent calving of PIG has not lead to increases in melting in either the shear margins or near the grounding line, which are particularly important for buttressing of the grounded ice sheet~\cite{Furst2016NatureClimCh, Reese2018NatureClimCh}. As a result, we do not expect that further buttressing losses associated with increased melt will take place as a result of the recent calving; this provides a negative feedback on ice shelf loss: the recent calving led to an acceleration of the grounded ice, and thus an increase of the flux of ice into the shelf; to maintain a constant ice shelf mass balance, melting must therefore increase. The lack of increase in melting after the 2020 calving therefore shifts the shelf mass balance towards positive, i.e. it promotes regrowth of the ice shelf.

However, if calving maintains its pace since 2015, the situation where the ice front sits above the ridge-crest will be realized in the mid 2020s. Large melt anomalies occur at both the shear margin and near the grounding line when the ice front is retreated to the ridge crest. Should this increase in flux out of the shelf (increase in melting) be larger than the resulting increase in flux to the shelf that results from ice sheet speed-up (from buttressing losses after calving), the ice shelf mass balance will reduce: calving will promote further ice shelf loss. However, these feedback arguments are qualitative; investigating the detailed response of the ice shelf mass balance after a calving event requires the use of a coupled ice-ocean mode, and is beyond the scope of this study. (Here, we concerned ourselves only with the immediate melt response to calving, rather than the subsequent ice dynamic response.)
%recent speed up leads to thinning and thus retreat, but also acceleration, which needs an increase in melt to balance. We find no increase in melt, so melt response (i.e. no response) will help to promote shelf regrowth. However, assessing this in detail needs use of a coupled ice ocean model. 



%In future melt rates generally increase in future, but changes are smaller than idealized results suggest (why?)
The magnitude of changes in melting with calving in our realistic simulations are similar to corresponding idealized simulations for the southern section of the cavity (i.e. very small), for which the offshore ridge-seabed gap is wide. However, for the northern section of the cavity (narrow ridge-seabed gap), the magnitude of changes are smaller than our idealized simulations predict. We attribute this difference to the complexities of the ice draft and seabed in the realistic simulations, and as well as our splitting of the inner cavity into two subsections. Splitting the cavity into two relies on the assumption that they are entirely dynamically disconnected; although a strong PV barrier exists between them, some flow is able to cross this barrier, providing a connection between the two regions. This inner cavity decomposition is also a convenient tool to allow us to capture some of the effect of the inhomogeneity in ridge-draft gap along its length, but further work is required to fully understand the role of this inhomogeneity in controlling warm water access to the inner cavity. In addition, the sensitivity to cavity geometry means that the observed response may in fact be somewhat different to that predicted here: if, for example, uncertainties in the seabed bathymetry and/or ice shelf draft mean that the gap is smaller than used in our realistic simulation, the melt response to calving might be significantly larger. In addition, the ice draft is not static but varies dynamically; advection of thicker (thinner, respectively) sections of the ice shelf to the ridge crest will narrow (widen) the ridge-draft gap and thus increase (decrease) the sensitivity of melt rates to calving.


%although melt responses are not massive there is uncertainty in the ridge-gap, which might be actual response is larger

%what do results mean for melt rate parametrizations 
The results presented in this paper have implications for melt rate parametrizations. At present, no melt rate parametrization is able to account for the position of the ice front, seabed topography, or any PV barrier when computing the melt rate~\cite{AsayDavis2017CurrClimChRep}; although the example of PIG is somewhat extreme in this sense, we have demonstrated that the combination of seabed ridge and ice front position, which ultimately act as PV barriers, can be an important controls on the melt rate applied to an ice shelf. This provides motivation for improvements in melt rate parametrizations. % Although the seabed ridge under PIIS is rather unique amongst ice shelves, it is one of the fastest changing and largest contributors to current ice loss front Antarctica; accurate future projections of PIG are       and thus most commonly simulated ice shelves. Often melt rate parametrizations are used in these simulations; our results suggest that current melt rate parametrizations must be enhanced to account for the seabed ridge if they are to be trusted in projections of PIIS.

%another source of uncertainty are parameter choices in the model, but they don't affect conclusions.
It is important to note that MITgcm has a plethora of parameter choices and numerical settings, which might have an impact on the results of the simulations. These include choices of grid resolution, which are 400~m in the horizontal (to ensure mesoscale eddies are well resolved) and 10~m in the vertical. Simulations at higher vertical resolution (5~m) did not change the results significantly, although results were somewhat different for lower resolution (20~m); this is perhaps unsurprising given that exchange over the ridge crest, which we have shown to be important in controlling the inner cavity melt rate, is expected to be highly sensitive to vertical resolution. Agreement with the higher resolution simulations gives us confidence that the simulations presented here are appropriately resolving exchange processes over the ridge crest. 


Finally, it is important to note that forcing in our simulations comes exclusively from buoyancy fluxes and restoring at the boundaries. In particular, the simulations do not include either surface heat fluxes nor sea ice, which would be expected to alter the horizontal density gradients and thus circulation in the open ocean. In addition, they do not include wind stresses, which provide a leading order control on circulation in Pine Island Bay~\cite{Dutrieux2014Science}.

\section{Summary}\label{S:Summary}
%general overview of the question and answer
The central aim of this study is to understand how, and why, melt rates on Pine Island Ice Shelf might respond to calving events that have already taken place, and those that might occur in future. We suggested at the outset that such calving events might relax the topographic barrier that currently restricts the access of warm water access to the cavity inshore of the ridge. We have used numerical simulations in both an idealized domain, and one that is representative of PIIS, to address this question.
%what did we see in the idealized simulations, and stress that they can be used as an archetype for situations in which there is a geometric barrier (e.g. if the ice shelf retreats on an overdeepened bed)

The idealized domain allowed us to isolate parametric dependence in the melt response to calving, and elucidate the mechanisms responsible for this response. We identified a sensitive dependence on the cavity geometry via the parameter $W$ that describes the gap between the seabed ridge and the ice base: configurations with a narrow gap ($W \lesssim$ 150~m) have a large response to calving, whereas those with wide gaps ($W>$150~m) do not. For cavities with narrow gaps, we saw that: (1) the inner cavity melt rate does not change significantly with ice front retreat while the ice front is located some way (more than 20~km) offshore of the ridge, (2) as the ice front is retreated towards the ridge, the inner cavity melt rate increases significantly, before (3) dropping off sharply when the ice front is retreated to sit on top of the ridge if the pycnocline is relatively high or (4) increasing further if the pycnocline is relatively deep. In contrast, for configurations with wide gaps, the melt rate is largely independent of the location of the ice front. We described the roles of thermal driving and boundary layer velocity in these results, and elucidated the role of heat access to (and resulting stratification of) the inner cavity in this response. In particular, we saw that increased heat access to the inner cavity may, paradoxically, reduce inner cavity melt rates when it results in reduced stratification and thus a deceleration of the cavity circulation. Although these idealized results are intended to inform our understanding of melt rate changes beneath Pine Island Glacier, they can also be considered to be an archetype for situations in which seabed geometry obscures access of warm water to the grounding line of an ice sheet. This situation might be realized, for example, in ice sheet retreat over an over-deepended bed. In addition, the results for wide gaps suggest that melt rates are insensitive to ice front position in cavities with no seabed ridge. 

%main details on the results of the realistic simulations: complex pattern of changes, large anomaly at the front from 2009-2020 might promote further calving, 
The idealized experiments informed simulations performed using a cavity geometry that closely resembles PIIS, designed to assess how melt rates on PIIS might respond to calving in practice. This geometry has two inner cavity regions, which are approximately dynamically disconnected. One of the inner cavity sections sits inshore of a narrow section of the ridge-draft gap; in this region the melt rate increases with calving while the ice front is located offshore of the ridge, before reducing with further calving beyond the ridge. In contrast, the other sits inshore of a wide section of the ridge-draft gap; there the melt rate is largely independent of calving. Both of these observations are consistent with the idealized simulations, and the role of heat access to the inner cavity. %By making an analogy with the idealized results, we suggest that the same competing mechanisms of heat access to the inner cavity and topographic confinement of the circulation are responsible.

Our results suggest that PIIS sits in a small safety band: melt rates in dynamically important regions will not change significantly until the ice front retreats closer to the ridge. This lack of melt rate response while the ice sheet accelerates in response to a loss of buttressing acts as a negative feedback, promoting regrowth of the shelf. However, if calving maintains its current pace, large increases in melt rates in these dynamically important regions will be realized sometime in the next decade or so; this increase in melt has the potential to act as a positive feedback in which the melt response to calving leads to further disintegration of the ice shelf. In addition, the sensitivity to cavity geometry identified in the idealized results, and uncertainty (or dynamic changes in) the cavity geometry mean that the observed response may be significantly larger than predicted here. 

%We stress, however, that this prediction is only based on melt rate response to calving, and does not account changes in ice shelf buttressing associated with the ice lost from a shelf during a calving event. In addition, our realistic simulations suggest that melt rates at the ice front have increased significantly as a result of calving between 2015 and 2020, and that a further calving event of this magnitude will lead to a large increase in melting in the northern shear margin. Both of these points may prove important for future ice shelf stability.

%The magnitude of changes in the realistic simulation were not as significant as in the idealized simulations. The scale of these changes suggests that the immediate loss of ice area, rather than longer term changes in ice thickness associated with melt rate changes, is currently, and will continue to be, the most important control on buttressing changes in response to calving in PIG. Making a quantitative comparison between the strength of these two (coupled) effects requires the use of a three-dimensional coupled ice-ocean model. However, the sensitivity to geometry in the idealized results suggests that errors in the (somewhat uncertain) ice draft and seabed bathymetry or future ice dynamic changes that reduce the ridge-draft gap, might increase the sensitivity of Pine Island to further calving.

% The main text should start with an introduction. Except for short
% manuscripts (such as comments and replies), the text should be divided
% into sections, each with its own heading.

% Headings should be sentence fragments and do not begin with a
% lowercase letter or number. Examples of good headings are:

% \section{Materials and Methods}
% Here is text on Materials and Methods.

% To create multiline equations, use the

\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:

%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
